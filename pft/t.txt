WARNING: The return values reported here may be bugged on some systems.
          See https://github.com/gavinfielder/pft/issues/11
          Run in non-fork mode (-X) to ensure accurate return value
          reporting, set IGNORE_RETURN_VALUE=1 in options-config.ini,
          or run test_pipes.sh to see if your system has this bug.
          This bug does not affect the pass/fail result of a test, nor
          the function output--only the reported return value.
